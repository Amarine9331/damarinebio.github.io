_I am currently looking for a postdoc in Geometric Deep Learning and Structural Bioinformatics !_


Welcome to my home page!

I am a PhD student with 
[Jean-Philippe Vert](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=pqpxh7IAAAAJ&hl=en)
and [Michael Nilges](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=FlN-N-EAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I work in the [Structural Bioinformatics unit](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/structural-bioinformatics/)
in Pasteur and the [Center for Computational Biology (CBIO)](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/) 
at les Mines ParisTech.

Before that, I studied at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, France and got a Master of Research degree 
in Computer Science from McGill University in Montréal, Canada with 
[Jérôme Waldispühl](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=IVZp2gQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Here is [my CV](/files/CV.pdf).
