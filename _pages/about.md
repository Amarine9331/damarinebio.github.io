Welcome to my home page!

I will post the link to my PhD defense on this page, stay tuned !

_I will start a post-doc with [Maks Ovsjanikov](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0IsSPNEAAAAJ&hl=en) next year on the use of surface methods for learning on the surface of proteins !_

I am a PhD student with 
[Jean-Philippe Vert](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=pqpxh7IAAAAJ&hl=en)
and [Michael Nilges](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=FlN-N-EAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I work in the [Structural Bioinformatics unit](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/structural-bioinformatics/)
in Pasteur and the [Center for Computational Biology (CBIO)](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/) 
at les Mines ParisTech. I work on the representation of biomolecules using geometric deep learning.

Before that, I studied at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, France and got a Master of Research degree 
in Computer Science from McGill University in Montréal, Canada with 
[Jérôme Waldispühl](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=IVZp2gQAAAAJ&hl=en).
I worked on a simple way to side-step the use of equivariant networks using PCA alignment.

Here is [my CV](/files/CV.pdf).
