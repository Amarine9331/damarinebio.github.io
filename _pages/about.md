Welcome to my home page!

I am a public researcher at _école des Mines de Paris_, in the [CBIO](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/) team. I am working on machine learning on biomolecules structures. My goal is to leverage the increasing amount of structural data with geometric deep learning to transform the fields of structural biology and drug design. 
I have three research directions : 
- finding the right representation for learning on RNA and protein structures
- finding how to go beyond static structures with cryo-EM and how to use conformations in machine learning applications
- applying those findings to structural bioinformatics and drug design

Previously to joining the CBIO, I did a post-doc with [Maks Ovsjanikov](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0IsSPNEAAAAJ&hl=en) working on protein representation and cryo-EM data analysis.
I did my [PhD](/files/PhD_vf.pdf) with [Jean-Philippe Vert](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=pqpxh7IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Michael Nilges](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=FlN-N-EAAAAJ&hl=en) on equivariant methods and drug design.
Before that, I studied at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and got a Master of Research degree in Computer Science from McGill University in Montréal with [Jérôme Waldispühl](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=IVZp2gQAAAAJ&hl=en), working on the structure of RNA.

Here is [my CV](/files/CV.pdf).
