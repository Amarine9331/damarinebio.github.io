Welcome to my home page!

I am a public researcher working on machine learning on biomolecules structures. My goal is to leverage the increasing amount of structural data with geometric deep learning to transform the fields of structural biology and drug design. 
I have three research directions : 
- finding the right representation for learning on RNA and protein structures
- finding how to go beyond static structures with cryo-EM and how to use conformations in machine learning applications
- applying those findings to structural bioinformatics and drug design

I am currently a post-doc with [Maks Ovsjanikov](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=0IsSPNEAAAAJ&hl=en).
I did my [PhD](/files/PhD_vf.pdf) [Jean-Philippe Vert](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=pqpxh7IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Michael Nilges](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=FlN-N-EAAAAJ&hl=en) in the [Structural Bioinformatics unit](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/structural-bioinformatics/) in Pasteur and the [Center for Computational Biology (CBIO)](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/) 
at les Mines ParisTech. Before that, I studied at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, France and got a Master of Research degree 
in Computer Science from McGill University in Montréal, Canada with 
[Jérôme Waldispühl](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=IVZp2gQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Here is [my CV](/files/CV.pdf).
